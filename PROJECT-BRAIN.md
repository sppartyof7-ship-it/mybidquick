# MyBidQuick â Project Brain

## What Is This?
MyBidQuick is a SaaS platform owned by **Tim Sullivan** (personally, NOT Cloute Inc). It's a white-label quoting tool that Tim sells to other cleaning companies. Each cleaning company gets their own branded quote page powered by MyBidQuick's engine.

## Business Model â Per-Lead Credit Billing
Tenants buy lead credit packs upfront. Each quote submission from a customer deducts 1 credit. New accounts get 3 free credits to try it out.

### Lead Credit Packs
| Pack | Credits | Price | Per Lead |
|------|---------|-------|----------|
| Starter | 10 | $25 | $2.50 |
| Growth | 25 | $50 | $2.00 |
| Pro | 50 | $85 | $1.70 |
| Agency | 100 | $150 | $1.50 |

### How It Works
1. Tenant signs up â gets 3 free lead credits
2. Tenant buys a credit pack via Stripe Checkout
3. Stripe webhook adds credits to their account in Supabase
4. Each customer quote submission deducts 1 credit + logs the charge
5. When credits run out, quote form stops accepting submissions (shows "NO_CREDITS" error)

## Architecture
Two repos (both under MyBidQuick):
1. **mybidquick** (this repo) â The SaaS platform: marketing site, onboarding wizard, admin dashboard
2. **mybidquick-engine** (formerly Cleanbid) â The quoting engine that generates quotes for customers

### How They Connect
- Tenant configs live in **Supabase** (tenants table with config JSONB column)
- URL pattern: `slug.mybidquick.com` (subdomain-style, e.g., `cloute-cleaning.mybidquick.com`)
- Slugs auto-generated from business name during onboarding (e.g., "Cloute Cleaning" â "cloute-cleaning")
- New companies can self-serve sign up WITHOUT any code changes

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (SPA with HashRouter)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS variables (in index.css)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Hosting**: Vercel (LIVE and deployed)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS) â tenant storage, leads, billing
- **Payments**: Stripe (per-lead credit billing via Checkout + Customer Portal)
- **Serverless API**: Vercel Functions (4 endpoints in `/api/`)
- **Domains**: mybidquick.com, mybidquick.io, mybidquick.org (all purchased via Vercel, all connected)
- **Vercel URL**: mybidquick.vercel.app

## Repo Info
- **GitHub**: github.com/sppartyof7-ship-it/mybidquick
- **Local Path (Tim's PC)**: C:\Users\Tim\Downloads\mybidquick

- [ ] Pack onboarding services/upsell data into config JSONB before createTenant()
- [ ] Add duplicate slug check before tenant creation

- [x] Port cascade upsell flow from QuoteDemo to mybidquick-engine (with tenant discount config)

- [ ] Referral program
- [ ] Blog / SEO content on mybidquick.com

### PHASE 5 â Exterior Cleaning Expansion (NEW â March 2026)
**Market**: Exterior building cleaning is a $12.5B market (2024) growing to $20.3B by 2033. U.S. pressure washing alone = $1.2B. 34,000+ pressure washing businesses in US, most using generic tools.

**Competitors**: ResponsiBid ($829 setup + $229/mo), QuoteIQ ($249/mo), Jobber ($69-349/mo). MyBidQuick is 10x cheaper with per-lead pricing.

#### Product Roadmap
- [ ] Add pressure washing as default service (sq ft pricing)
- [ ] Add soft washing as a service option
- [ ] Add fence cleaning as a service option
- [ ] Add surface material type modifier (vinyl, brick, stucco, wood â different multipliers)
- [ ] Add roof pitch/slope estimator for roof cleaning
- [ ] Add story count surcharge (2nd story = 1.3x, 3rd = 1.6x)
- [ ] Add condition modifier (light/moderate/heavy)
- [ ] Add "What type of cleaning company?" to onboarding Step 1
- [ ] Auto-populate services based on company type
- [ ] Expand cascade upsells: pressure wash â sealing, house wash â soffit/fascia
- [ ] Commercial quoting support (larger properties)
- [ ] Seasonal pricing (peak-season surcharges)

#### Go-To-Market Strategy
- **Facebook Groups**: Join pressure washing biz groups (50K+ combined members), share value-first content
- **Before/After Content**: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts â 3-5x engagement
- **Google Ads**: Target "pressure washing estimate software" keywords ($500-1K/month)
- **YouTube Tutorials**: "How to Price Pressure Washing Jobs" educational content â funnel to MBQ
- **Partnerships**: Equipment suppliers, training programs, affiliate program for tenants
- **SEO/Blog**: Target 10-15 pressure washing pricing keywords in 6 months

## Related Repos
- **mybidquick-engine** (formerly Cleanbid/ClouteBid): github.com (separate repo) â The customer-facing quoting engine, currently deployed at cleanbid.vercel.app (to be rebranded). Has its own admin panel at `#admin` (password: admin123) with AdminPanel.jsx, LeadsPanel.jsx, config-driven architecture. All under the MyBidQuick brand now.

## Session Log
| Date | What We Did |
|------|------------|
| 2026-03-25 | Built entire MVP: landing page, onboarding wizard, admin dashboard. Pushed to GitHub. Deployed to Vercel. Purchased & connected mybidquick.com, .io, .org domains. |
| 2026-03-26 | Added window cleaning upsell feature (onboarding config + QuoteDemo page). Upgraded to smart cascade upsell (house wash â windows â gutters). Built full tenant admin dashboard â 6 tabs (Pricing, Services, Bundles, Marketing, Followup, Settings) + Leads/CRM panel. Fixed Followup tab JSX bug. |
| 2026-03-26 | Connected Supabase database (tenant storage, leads). Migrated Onboarding + AdminDashboard from localStorage to Supabase (with fallback). Switched tenant URL pattern to subdomain-style (slug.mybidquick.com). Built full Stripe per-lead billing integration: 4 serverless API routes, Billing tab in tenant dashboard, credit deduction on lead creation. Added billing schema to Supabase (lead_charges, credit_purchases tables). Tested end-to-end: Billing tab shows 3 free credits, Buy Leads buttons redirect to Stripe Checkout. |
| 2026-03-27 | Created MyBidQuick logo (lightning bolt + speed lines, navy/orange palette) in SVG + PNG. Also generated via ChatGPT/DALL-E for high-quality AI version. Researched exterior cleaning market expansion: $12.5B market, 34K+ pressure washing businesses. Built full product roadmap (Phase 5) and go-to-market strategy. Added comprehensive research page to Notion brain. Updated PROJECT-BRAIN.md with Phase 5 expansion plan. |
| 2026-03-27 | Brand consolidation: everything is now under **MyBidQuick**. Removed all ClouteBid/Cleanbid branding from PROJECT-BRAIN.md. Quoting engine repo rebranded as "mybidquick-engine" (code-level rename still pending). |
| 2026-03-27 | **Supabase Auth**: Real authentication replacing admin123. Onboarding creates auth user (email+password), Login.jsx page with forgot password, TenantDashboard auto-detects session, auth_user_id column + RLS policies on tenants table. **Engine upsell discount**: wired tenant's `upsell.discountPercent` into CustomerFlow.jsx â shows "Save X%!" badges, applies discount to upselled service pricing. |
| 2026-03-27 | **Soft launch QA audit**: Full code walkthrough identified 15 issues across 4 severity levels (3 critical, 4 high, 5 medium, 3 low). Created SOFT-LAUNCH-ISSUES.md with fixes and readiness assessment. Verdict: not ready for self-serve launch, but White-Glove path viable. Created MyBidQuick-Onboarding-SOP.docx for manual tenant onboarding. Added `/onboarding` route alias in App.jsx. |
